Use this widget to add adbrite ads to your sidebar and change colors dynamically. This plugin for wordpress is great at allowing you to change the colors without going through somewhat awkward process of changing it on the adbrite site, or messing with the javascript code by hand.

Frequent users to your site will become ad-blind and not see the ads on your site.  A simple and clever way to overcome this to rotate the colors scheme of the ads every week or so.  Choose outlandish colors sometimes and subtle colors at other times.

You need to <a href="http://caliaccountant.com/make-money-with-adbrite/#sign">Sign up for Adbrite</a> and

== Installation ==

1. Upload folder into to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use your 'Presentation'/'Sidebar Widgets' settings to drag and configure

== Configuration ==

* Widget title: the title of the widget
* Ad Code From AdBrite: insert code from adbrite - must be a 'banners & text' ad block to work correctly
* Color Choosers - use colors choosers to change default colors of adbrite ads.  Some ads may override these settings.

== Faq ==
Sometimes the colors of the adbrite ads are overridden by the actual ads from adbrite.  This is especially true of flash ads, which do not use the colors at all.
